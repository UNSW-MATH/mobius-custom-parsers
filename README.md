# Mobius Custom Parsers

## Maple Parser

_Details to be added soon._

## Matlab Parser

Running the file `Matlab/matlab_previewer.mpl` using the Maple will generate the files:

- PreviewMatlabExpression.ind
- PreviewMatlabExpression.lib
- PreviewMatlabMatrix.ind
- PreviewMatlabMatrix.lib

You can combine these into a single `.zip` file and upload them to Mobius in one step. Please note that you probably need to delete the `.ind` and `.lib` files if you are running genrating the files a second time.

### Testing Matlab example expressions

If you uncomment the `quit` command you can also generate the following html file for sanity checking some common example.
